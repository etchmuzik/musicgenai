# ✅ ALL WARNINGS & ERRORS FIXED - PRODUCTION READY

## **🔧 FINAL FIXES COMPLETED:**

### **1. Conditional Cast Warning** ✅ FIXED
- **File**: `FirebaseManager.swift:514`
- **Issue**: `Conditional cast from '[String : Any]' to '[String : Any]' always succeeds`
- **Fix**: Removed unnecessary conditional cast
- **Before**: `guard let data = doc.data() as? [String: Any] else { return nil }`
- **After**: `let data = doc.data()`

### **2. Actor Context Warnings** ✅ FIXED
- **File**: `TrackPlayer.swift:61` & `TrackPlayer.swift:164`
- **Issue**: Calls to `@MainActor` methods from non-actor context
- **Fix**: Wrapped calls in `Task { @MainActor in ... }`
- **Result**: Proper actor isolation maintained

### **3. Property Mutation Warning** ✅ FIXED
- **File**: `TrackPlayer.swift:164`
- **Issue**: `currentTime` mutation from outside actor context
- **Fix**: Protected with `@MainActor` task wrapper
- **Result**: Thread-safe property updates
