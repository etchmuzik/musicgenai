   - "Target Properties"
6. Click the "+" button next to any existing property
```

### **Method 2: If You Don't See Info Tab**
```bash
1. Make sure you selected the TARGET (not project)
2. Look for these tabs: General | Signing & Capabilities | Info | Build Settings
3. If no Info tab, try "Build Settings" â†’ Search "INFOPLIST"
```

### **Method 3: Create Info.plist File**

## **ðŸ“‹ STEP-BY-STEP WITH SCREENSHOTS DESCRIPTION:**

### **What You Should See:**
1. **Project Navigator** (left panel with files)
2. **Blue project icon** at the very top of the file list
3. **TARGET section** showing "musicgenmain" 
4. **Tabs across top**: General, Signing & Capabilities, Info, Build Settings
5. **Info tab content** with existing properties like:
   - Bundle Display Name
   - Bundle Identifier  
   - Bundle Version
   - etc.

### **Adding New Property:**
1. **Click "+" button** (usually bottom-right of the properties list)
2. **Type**: `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
3. **Value**: `This app needs microphone access to record audio for music generation`
4. **Press Enter**
5. **Repeat** for other permissions

## **ðŸš¨ IF YOU STILL CAN'T FIND IT:**

### **Alternative: Build Settings Method**
```bash
1. Click "Build Settings" tab instead of Info
2. Search for: "INFOPLIST_KEY"
3. Look for: "Info.plist Values"
4. Add custom keys there
```

### **Manual Info.plist Creation**
```bash
1. Right-click musicgenmain folder â†’ New File
2. iOS â†’ Resource â†’ Property List
3. Name: Info.plist
4. Add the permissions in this new file
```

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ WHAT THE INTERFACE LOOKS LIKE:**

### **Target Selection (IMPORTANT!):**
```
PROJECT
â”œâ”€â”€ musicgenmain (this is the PROJECT - don't click this)
TARGETS  
â”œâ”€â”€ musicgenmain (this is the TARGET - click this one!)
â”œâ”€â”€ musicgenmainTests
â”œâ”€â”€ musicgenmainUITests
```

### **Tab Layout:**
```
[General] [Signing & Capabilities] [Info] [Build Settings] [Build Phases]
                                    â†‘
                                Click here
```

---

## **ðŸ’¡ MODERN XCODE TIP:**

In newer Xcode versions, some permissions are in:
```bash
Signing & Capabilities â†’ + Capability â†’ App Sandbox
```

But for basic permissions, use the Info tab method above.

---

## **âš¡ QUICK TEST:**

After adding permissions:
1. **Clean Build**: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder
2. **Rebuild**: Command + B
3. **Install on iPhone**: Command + R
4. **Test music generation**
5. **iPhone should prompt for microphone access**
